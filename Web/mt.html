            <h2>Climbing History</h2>
            <p>The first recorded attempts to climb Everest were made by British mountaineers in the 1920s from the Tibetan side. The north access was closed after 1949, and the only approach was from Nepal.</p>
            <p>On May 29, 1953, Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa of Nepal, became the first climbers confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. They were part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt.</p>
            <p>As of December 2022, 6,338 different people have reached the summit of Mount Everest. Kami Rita Sherpa holds the record for most ascents at 26.</p>
